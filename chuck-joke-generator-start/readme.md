# Chuck Norris Jokes Generator

## **Project Overview**

This project is a simple web application that fetches and displays random Chuck Norris jokes using an API. The goal was to create an interactive and visually appealing way for users to enjoy jokes with minimal setup and functionality.

## **Features**
1. **Fetch Random Jokes**:
   - The app uses the [Chuck Norris Joke API](https://api.chucknorris.io/) to retrieve random jokes.
   - Users can click a button to fetch and display a new joke dynamically.

2. **Loading State**:
   - Displays a "Loading..." message while the joke is being fetched to improve user experience.

3. **Dynamic UI Updates**:
   - Replaces the previous joke with a new one upon button click, ensuring only one joke is shown at a time.

4. **Responsive Design**:
   - The layout is fully responsive, optimized for both desktop and mobile screens.

## **Technical Details**

### **HTML**
- **Structure**:
  - Includes a container with a heading, a joke display area, and a button to fetch new jokes.
  - Script and stylesheet are linked to keep the JavaScript and CSS separate.

### **CSS**
- **Styling**:
  - The design uses modern and clean aesthetics with a Roboto font.
  - `container` is styled for a centered, card-like appearance with shadows for depth.
  - `btn` includes hover effects for better interactivity.
- **Responsive Design**:
  - The design adjusts to different screen sizes, ensuring a seamless user experience.

### **JavaScript**
- **Core Functionality**:
  - Fetches jokes from the API using `XMLHttpRequest`.
  - Replaces the "Loading..." message or previous joke with the new joke dynamically.
- **Event Handling**:
  - The `Get Another Joke` button triggers the joke-fetching process.
- **Error Handling**:
  - Ensures smooth transitions between states, preventing leftover text like "Loading...".

## **How It Works**

1. **Initialization**:
   - When the page loads, a joke is fetched automatically, showing "Loading..." until the data is received.

2. **Fetching New Jokes**:
   - Each button click sends a new request to the API, replacing the current joke with a new one.

3. **Updating the DOM**:
   - The joke is displayed dynamically using DOM manipulation, ensuring a single, clean interface.
